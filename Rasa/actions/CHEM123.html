<h2><strong>Course Description and Objectives</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p>By the end of this course students will:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>CLO1: Apply the concepts of general inorganic chemistry. These include basic definitions of matter and chemistry, use of the periodic table, writing, drawing, and naming chemical formulas, performing simple calculations involving dimensional analysis and simple stoichiometry, gas laws, solubility and solutions, reduction/oxidation, and acid/base chemistry.<br><br></li>
<li>CLO 2: Apply the basic concepts of Organic Chemistry. These include physical properties, IUPAC naming, and common reactions of the following functional groups: alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, aromatic compounds, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and amines.<br><br></li>
<li>CLO 3: Apply the basic concepts of Biochemistry as it applies to the metabolism of macronutrients (protein, lipid, and carbohydrate) in the formation of ATP, and the relationship of organic chemistry to the formation/break-down of these macronutrients.</li>

<h4><b>Course Communication Guides:&nbsp;</b></h4>
<p>Official University Conduct-Related Correspondence University email is the University of Louisiana at Lafayette's primary means of communication with students. Students are responsible for all communication delivered to their University email address.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><b>Netiquette:</b><br></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Taking a class online is quite different than sitting and communicating in a face-to-face classroom. Much of the communication is actually lost because facial expressions or body language cannot be seen, nor can the tone of voice that the sender intended to be heard. For these reasons here are some tips to remember when communicating online:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The course is still a classroom and you must treat faculty and other students with respect.</li>
<li>Read and re-read emails and posts before sending them. Read them aloud to make sure they don’t sound offensive.</li>
<li>Think and take a breath before you send especially if what you are discussing/sending relates to an emotionally charged issue.</li>
<li>Avoid the use of all caps and "netspeak." For example, "BTW," "FYI."</li>
<li>Watch your language, humor, and sarcasm; all may be misinterpreted.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Email Etiquette:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Use a greeting and a closing.</li>
<li>Use the correct level of formality for the person to whom you are addressing the content.</li>
<li>Read aloud before sending to make sure the tone is correct.</li>
<li>Be concise.</li>
<li>Don't forward emails without permission of the original sender.</li>
<li>Use the correct grammar, spelling, punctuation and sentence structure. All of these things give an impression of your professionalism.</li>
<li>Avoid inappropriate email addresses.</li>
<li>If an email is not the right venue to voice your concerns, ask for permission to contact the individual by phone.</li>
</ul>
<b>Discussion Board Netiquette:</b>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Make your posts stay on topic and do not post irrelevant information.</li>
<li>Review and edit your posts before submitting.</li>
<li>Make a brief and thorough comment</li>
<li>Give proper credit when referencing or quoting another source</li>
<li>Be sure to read all message in a thread before posting or replying</li>
<li>Avoid&nbsp;short and generic replies such as "I agree"/"I think so". You should explain why you agree.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Respect opinions of your classmates even when they differ from your own. You should express your differing opinion in a respectful, non-cricial way.</li>
<li>Do not make personal or insulting remarks.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h4><b>Code of Student Conduct:</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The Code of Student Conduct is designed to enhance and uphold the purposes, goals, and processes of this University. It is understood that all students should be knowledgeable of and abide by the Code of Student Conduct. The Code of Student Conduct may be applied to behavior conducted online, via email or other electronic media. The Code of Student Conduct can be found online at <a href="https://studentrights.louisiana.edu/student-conduct/code-conduct" target="_blank">https://studentrights.louisiana.edu/student-conduct/code-conduct</a>. For more information, contact the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities at 482-6373 or <a href="mailto:srr@louisiana.edu" target="_blank">srr@louisiana.edu</a></p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Academic Honesty:</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p align="left">The University holds that all work for which a student will receive a grade or credit shall be an original contribution or shall be properly documented to indicate sources. Abrogation of this principle entails dishonesty, defeats the purpose of instruction, and undermines the high goals of the University. Cheating in any form will not be tolerated. Students shall be assumed to know the acceptable methods and techniques for proper documentation of sources and to avoid cheating and plagiarism in all work submitted for credit, whether prepared in or out of class.</p>
<p>Cheating, in the context of academic matters, is the term broadly used to describe all acts of dishonesty committed in taking tests or examinations and in preparing assignments. Cheating includes but is not limited to such practices as gaining help from another person or using unauthorized notes when taking a test, relying on a calculator if such an aid has been forbidden, and preparing an assignment in consultation with another person when the instructor expects the work to be done independently. In other words, cheating occurs when a student makes use of any unauthorized aids or materials. Furthermore, any student who provides unauthorized assistance in academic work is also guilty of cheating.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Plagiarism is a specific type of cheating. It occurs when a student claims originality for the ideas or words of another person, when the student presents as a new and original idea or product anything which in fact is derived from an existing work, or when the student makes use of any work or production already created by someone else without giving credit to the source. In short, plagiarism is the use of unacknowledged materials in the preparation of assignments. The student must take care to avoid plagiarism in research or term papers, musical compositions, science reports, laboratory experiments, and theses and dissertations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The University considers both cheating and plagiarism serious offenses. The minimum penalty for a student responsible of either dishonest act is a grade of “zero” for the assignment in question. The maximum penalty is dismissal from the University. The complete policy may be found in the UL Lafayette Undergraduate and Graduate Acamedic Catalog. Please go to&nbsp;<a href="https://catalog.louisiana.edu/" target="_blank">https://catalog.louisiana.edu/</a>&nbsp;, click Policies&nbsp;from the menu in the left column, and click Academic Honesty under Rules &amp; Regulations list.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h4><b>Disability Accommodations:</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) to verify the disability and to establish eligibility for accommodations. Students may call 337-482-5252 to register with ODS. Once registered, students should then schedule an appointment with the professor to make appropriate arrangments.&nbsp;At the beginning of every semester, students are required to contact ODS to update your information, and ODS will print accommodations letters for the students.</p>
<p>Students can also visit the <a href="https://disability.louisiana.edu/content/student-information" target="_blank">ODS website</a> for Student Information on ODS services and on&nbsp;eligibility requirements.</p>

<h2><strong>Course Evaluation - Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEIs)</strong></h2>
<p>Student Evaluation of Instruction (SEI) is one of the University’s most important means of improving the quality of instruction at the University. The results have a direct impact on faculty, on teaching and on students. Towards the end of each semester, all students will receive an email from the Office of Academic Affairs announcing when the evaluation period of each course is open. The email will provide instructions on how to access the online course evaluations and the time of the closing period. Students are encouraged to complete all evaluations as soon as possible.</p>
