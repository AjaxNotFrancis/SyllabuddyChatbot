## Getting Project Setup
1. Open PyCharm and create a new project named "SyllabuddyChatbot"
-- You can use whichever version of Python 3 you want, it's best to use the most up to date one

2. At the bottom of the IDE, click "Terminal" 

3. Enter the following commands to install the necessary packages:
`pip3 install rasa`
`pip3 install beautifulsoup4`

4. Wait for them to install, it might take a minute to download and install all the dependencies

5. Now, still in terminal, use the following command to get the necessary files from github:
`git pull https://github.com/AjaxNotFrancis/SyllabuddyChatbot.git main`

6. There should be a new folder in the directory, Rasa, with a bunch of files and folders. This is where Rasa's training data and configuration files are located. Still in terminal, change directory to this Rasa folder with:
`cd Rasa`

7. Train model using:
`rasa train`
